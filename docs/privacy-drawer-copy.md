# Privacy Information

## How Privxx Protects You

### Private Browsing
When you connect through Privxx, your web activity is routed through a privacy layer that removes identifying metadata such as IP address and location.

### Private Payments
Privxx prevents observers from linking financial activity back to your identity by separating routing metadata from transaction endpoints.

### What Privxx Does Not Do
- We do not track users
- We do not store browsing history
- We do not profile activity

### Transparency Note
This version demonstrates the connection flow and interface.
Full cryptographic routing via cMixx will be integrated next.
