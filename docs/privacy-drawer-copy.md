## Drawer Title

> **How Privxx protects you**

---

## Section 1 — Browsing

### Private browsing, by design

When you connect through Privxx, your web requests are routed through a privacy network that removes identifying metadata.

This prevents tracking based on IP address, location, or browsing patterns.

---

## Section 2 — Payments

### Private payments

Privxx separates your identity from your transactions.

Whether you're connecting to a merchant or a payment endpoint, Privxx prevents observers from linking payments back to you.

---

## Section 3 — What We Don't Do

### What we don't see

- Privxx does not track you.
- Privxx does not store browsing history.
- Privxx does not profile your activity.

---

## Section 4 — Transparency Note

### Current status

This version of Privxx demonstrates the connection flow and interface.

Full cryptographic routing via cMixx will be integrated next.
