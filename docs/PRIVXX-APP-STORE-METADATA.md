Privxx helps reduce your digital footprint when browsing online.

Unlike traditional privacy tools, Privxx is designed to minimize metadata exposure — the hidden information that reveals your location, timing patterns, and device details, even when your content is encrypted.

KEY FEATURES

• Simple Privacy
One-tap connection to a privacy-preserving network. No technical knowledge required.

• Metadata Protection
Designed to reduce exposure of IP address, timing patterns, and device fingerprints.

• No Tracking
Zero cookies, analytics, or persistent identifiers. Your activity stays yours.

• Multi-Language Support
Available in 16 languages with full RTL support.

• Works Everywhere
Install as an app on iPhone, iPad, Android, or desktop browsers.

HOW IT WORKS

Privxx routes your connection through a decentralized network designed to break correlation between your identity and your online activity. This approach aims to provide stronger privacy than traditional VPNs.

TRANSPARENCY

Privxx is honest about what it does and doesn't do. We reduce metadata exposure — we don't promise absolute anonymity. Features in development are clearly labeled.

PRIVACY BY DESIGN

• No account required
• No data collection
• No third-party analytics
• Session-only preferences
