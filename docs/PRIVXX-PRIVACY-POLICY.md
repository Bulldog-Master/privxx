## Introduction

Privxx ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our application handles information when you use Privxx.

**Summary:** Privxx does not collect, store, or share your personal data.

## Information We Do NOT Collect

Privxx is designed with privacy as a core principle. We do not collect:

- Personal information (name, email, phone number)
- Location data
- Device identifiers
- IP addresses
- Browsing history
- Usage analytics

## Information Stored Locally

Privxx may store the following information **only on your device** during your session:

## How Privxx Works

Privxx is designed to reduce metadata exposure when browsing online. When fully operational:

- Your connection is routed through a decentralized network
- Traffic is encrypted using post-quantum-safe cryptography
- No single point in the network sees both your identity and destination

**Current Status:** Privxx is in preview mode. Network routing is simulated and no external connections are made.

---

## Third-Party Services

Privxx does not integrate with:

- Analytics services (Google Analytics, Firebase, etc.)
- Advertising networks
- Social media platforms
- Third-party tracking tools

---

## Data Sharing

We do not sell, rent, or share any user data because we do not collect any user data.

---

## Children's Privacy

Privxx does not knowingly collect information from children under 13 (or applicable age in your jurisdiction). The app does not require account creation or personal information.

---

## Data Security

Since Privxx does not collect or store personal data, there is no user data at risk. The application is designed to minimize data exposure by default.

## Your Rights

Depending on your location, you may have rights under data protection laws (GDPR, CCPA, etc.). Since Privxx does not collect personal data:

- **Right to Access:** No personal data is stored
- **Right to Deletion:** No personal data exists to delete
