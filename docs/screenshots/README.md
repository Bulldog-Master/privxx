# Privxx Screenshot Governance

This folder contains the **only approved screenshots** of the Privxx UI.

Screenshots are treated as **canonical visual artifacts** and must always
reflect the currently locked UI and brand.

If a screenshot does not comply with these rules, it must not be used.

---

## Authoritative References
All screenshots must conform to:
- `docs/brand-ui-lock.md`
- `docs/PRIVXX-DESIGN-CONSTITUTION.md`
- `docs/PRIVXX-WHAT-CHANGES-WHAT-DOESNT.md`

---

## Purpose
Screenshots are used for:
- documentation
- demos
- presentations
- stakeholder reviews
- future development reference

Incorrect or outdated screenshots cause confusion and UI drift.
