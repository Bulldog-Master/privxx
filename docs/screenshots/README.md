# Canonical Screenshots

These screenshots are the **single source of truth** for Privxx UI visuals.
If a screen differs from these images, the UI is considered **out of spec**.

## 1) Home — Idle (Locked)
**File:** `docs/screenshots/home-idle.png`  
**What it proves:**
- Background is the locked "vibrant spheres + gradient haze" style
- Top-left icons are **globe above** and **Privacy** below
- The "Priv" wordmark is gradient and includes the xx logo mark
- Connection panel uses the same gradient treatment on:
  - URL field row
  - Connect row
  - Status row
- Status shows:
  - **Idle**
  - **Ready to connect privately** (subtext)

## 2) Privacy Drawer — Open (Locked)
**File:** `docs/screenshots/privacy-drawer-open.png`  
**What it proves:**
- Drawer title: "How Privxx protects you"
- Sections:
  - Intro paragraph + preview note
  - "Privxx is designed to:" bullet list
  - "Privxx does not:" bullet list
  - "Current status" note re: demo + cMixx coming next
- Icons and spacing match the locked look

## Optional (later, Phase D)
**Files (optional):**
- `docs/screenshots/home-connecting.png`
- `docs/screenshots/home-connected.png`

Only add these once we have consistent state visuals.
