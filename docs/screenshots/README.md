# Privxx — Screenshot Governance

This folder contains the **only approved screenshots** of the Privxx UI.

Screenshots are treated as **canonical visual artifacts** and must always reflect the
current locked UI defined in:

- `docs/brand-ui-lock.md`
- `docs/PRIVXX-DESIGN-CONSTITUTION.md`

---

## Purpose
Screenshots are used for:
- documentation
- demos
- presentations
- stakeholder reviews
- future development reference

Incorrect or outdated screenshots cause confusion and UI drift.

---

## Approved Screenshots (Required)

**Filename:**  
`privxx-home-idle.png`

**Must show:**
- Privxx logo (correct styling, no white box)
- URL input field
- "Connect through Privxx" button (Idle background style)
- Status: Idle
- Full background visible

---

### 2) Connecting State
**Filename:**  
`privxx-connecting.png`

**Must show:**

### 4) Privacy Drawer Open
**Filename:**  
`privxx-privacy-drawer.png`

**Must show:**

---

## Rules (Non-Negotiable)

- Screenshots must be taken from the **actual running app**
- No mockups, Figma exports, or edited composites
- No experimental or unreleased UI states
- No cropping that removes context
- No dark-mode or alternative themes unless explicitly approved

---

## Enforcement

If a screenshot does not match the locked UI:
- It must not be used
- It must be replaced or removed

Only screenshots in this folder are considered valid references.
