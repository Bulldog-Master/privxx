# Privxx Design Constitution

**Version 1.0 — Ratified & Locked**

---

## Purpose

This document defines the immutable visual and interaction identity of Privxx.

Its purpose is to prevent UI drift, ensure brand consistency, and protect the trust model of the product.

---

## Core Principle

**Privxx is a trust surface.**

Anything that looks inconsistent, improvised, or decorative erodes confidence.

---

## Non-Negotiables (Hard Rules)

### Brand & Logo

- **"Privxx" is never plain text**
- Must always appear as:
  - **Priv** (gradient text: pink → gold → teal)
  - **xx** (official xx Network symbol)
- The xx symbol:
  - Uses the official teal version
  - Has no background box
  - No white square
  - No alternative icon

❌ No substitutions  
❌ No monochrome fallback  
❌ No icon-only usage  

---

### Color & Background

- Background is **two-layered**:
  - **Base:** deep slate/blue
  - **Overlay:** vibrant gradient field (teal → green → amber → red)
- This represents:
  - Browsing layer
  - Financial routing layer

**Flat, white, grey, or "minimal" backgrounds are not permitted.**

---

### Buttons & Status

- Primary action and Idle state must share the **same background family**
- The difference is **state**, not color
- This avoids visual hierarchy confusion

---

### Privacy Control

- Privacy button uses:
  - Same gradient language
  - Same opacity logic
- No dark, flat, or outline-only privacy controls

---

## Enforcement

Any UI change must:
1. Match this document
2. Update `docs/brand-ui-lock.md`

**Violations must be reverted immediately.**

---

## Scope

Applies to:
- Demo
- MVP
- Marketing previews
- Documentation screenshots
- Future cMixx integrations

---

## Reference

Full specifications: [`docs/brand-ui-lock.md`](brand-ui-lock.md)

*This constitution protects Privxx from design drift, scope creep, and well-meaning "improvements" that erode brand coherence.*
