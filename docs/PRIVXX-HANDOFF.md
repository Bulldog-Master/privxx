# Privxx Project Handoff

## What Privxx Is
Privxx is a privacy-first access layer designed to protect metadata
while keeping the user experience calm, modern, and human-friendly.

---

## Current Status
- UI and brand are locked
- Demo flow is stable
- Routing is currently simulated
- Documentation is complete and authoritative

---

## What Is Locked (Do Not Change)
- UI layout
- Background and gradients
- Logo usage
- Button styles
- Copy and wording
- Demo flow

See:
- brand-ui-lock.md
- PRIVXX-DESIGN-CONSTITUTION.md

---

## What Is Actively Being Worked On
- Phase D: cMixx proof-of-integration
- Replace simulated routing with real cMixx control-channel events
- Logging and observability

UI must not change during this phase.

If you are unsure whether a change is allowed:

## Guiding Principle
Privxx values:
- trust over flash
- clarity over cleverness
- privacy without intimidation
