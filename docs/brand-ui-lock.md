# Privxx — Brand & UI Lock (v1)

## UI STATUS: LOCKED

**This document defines the only approved visual representation of Privxx.**

Any UI, demo, prototype, or integration must match this design unless explicitly approved and versioned.

This lock applies to:
- Logo usage
- Colors & gradients
- Background style
- Button styles
- Privacy controls
- Status indicators

This prevents:
- "small improvements"
- accidental redesigns
- AI tools "getting creative"

**Changes going forward must be:**
- Functional only
- Accessibility-related
- Performance-related

**No aesthetic changes without explicit design review.**

---

## What's Locked

- Background system (layered gradients, circular forms)
- Button styles (glass/translucent with gradient text)
- Logo usage (Priv gradient text + teal xx Network mark)
- Logo spacing (tight kerning: sm=-0.2em, md=-0.25em, lg=-0.3em)
- Color relationships (warm-to-teal gradients)
- Glass / translucency treatment
- Input field styling

---

## Privxx Name & Logo Rules (Non-Negotiable)

**"Privxx" is NEVER plain text in UI elements.**

Always rendered as:
- **Priv** (gradient text: pink → gold → teal)
- **xx** (official xx Network logo mark, teal color)

Never:
- ❌ Different colors
- ❌ Different spacing
- ❌ Text-only fallback
- ❌ Emoji substitutes
- ❌ Icons replacing the xx
- ❌ White/light background behind xx mark
- ❌ Faded or low-contrast logos

**This applies everywhere:** header, buttons, status text, CTAs, screenshots.

---

## UI Consistency Checklist

Use this to verify any change:

**Header**
- ✅ Privxx logo matches locked design
- ✅ No white background behind xx
- ✅ Gradient preserved

**Primary Action**
- ✅ "Connect through Privxx" button
- ✅ Same background style as card
- ✅ Logo visible and legible

**Status**
- ✅ Idle uses same visual language
- ✅ No color conflict with action button

**Privacy Control**
- ✅ Same gradient family
- ✅ Same opacity / border radius
- ✅ No standalone dark/flat button

**If any item fails → reject change.**

---

## Key Principles

- Glass / translucent UI elements (buttons, cards, controls)
- Abstract, layered gradient background with circular forms
- Consistent Privxx logo usage everywhere (Priv gradient + teal xx mark)
- No solid CTA fills that compete with the logo
- Non-regional, global design language
- Calm, premium, privacy-first aesthetic

Any future UI changes must:
- Preserve translucency
- Preserve logo hierarchy
- Avoid solid dominant colors

---

## Approved Direction

- Vibrant, modern, AI-futurist look
- Layered background with depth
- Glassmorphism central card
- Teal / aqua / cyan accents
- Deep blue base (not black, not grey)

Privxx must feel:
- Global
- Human-first
- Modern / AI-futurist
- Trustworthy
- Vibrant but controlled

---

## Background Rules

Background must visually represent two conceptual layers:

**Layer A — Browsing / Internet**
- Globe, network nodes, connection paths
- Soft abstract "web" geometry

**Layer B — Payments / Finance**
- Card shapes, currency symbols, transaction flows
- Subtle financial nodes

These elements must be abstract and tasteful, not literal illustrations.

**Banned:**
- No people
- No cultural or regional imagery
- No stock photos

---

## Color Palette

Primary tones:
- Teal / Aqua / Cyan gradients
- Deep blue background base
- Subtle warm accent gradients (pink / gold / green blend near bottom)

Rules:
- No grey-dominant UI
- No pure white backgrounds
- No black backgrounds
- Maintain high contrast but soft edges

---

## UI Card (Center Panel)

- Glassmorphism style with soft blur
- Rounded corners, floating effect

Required elements (in order):
1. URL input with globe icon
2. Primary CTA button
3. Status indicator (Idle / Connecting / Secure)

CTA button:
- Glass / translucent style matching card
- No solid teal fill
- Includes Privxx logo styling
- Logo must be clearly visible, not competing with background
- Must feel confident and inviting

---

## xx Mark (FINAL)

The xx mark is now the official teal xx Network logo asset.
Rendered as "Priv" text + xx logo image (transparent PNG).

Rules:
- Do NOT redesign the xx
- Do NOT reinterpret the xx
- Do NOT change its geometry
- Do NOT animate or stylize it independently
- Logo bottom aligns with text baseline
- Tight spacing — must look like part of the word

---

## Language Selector

- Single globe icon
- Dropdown list
- Alphabetical order
- English always pinned at the top

No flag icons.

---

## Brand Principle

Privxx is not:
- Regional
- Minimal for the sake of minimalism
- Cold or sterile
- Dark or oppressive

**Privxx stands for:**

> Private access to the internet and payments — without fear, friction, or exposure.

The UI should feel like:
- Safety
- Confidence
- Clarity
- Momentum

---

## What to Avoid

- Flat white or grey designs
- Dark or oppressive themes
- Pastel wellness aesthetics
- Literal illustrations (people, money piles)
- Cultural styling
- Reverting to previous rejected versions
- Experimenting visually without approval

---

## What NOT to Do

❌ "Simplify" further  
❌ Introduce cultural styling  
❌ Revert to previous rejected versions  
❌ Experiment visually without approval  
❌ Use plain text "Privxx" in buttons or headers  
❌ Change logo spacing or colors  

**This direction is approved and locked.**
