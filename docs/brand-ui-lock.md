# Privxx — Brand & UI Lock (v1)

## FINAL UI LOCK (v1)

The Privxx UI is now visually locked.

Key principles:
- Glass / translucent UI elements (buttons, cards, controls)
- Abstract, layered gradient background with circular forms
- Consistent Privxx logo usage everywhere (Priv + teal xx mark)
- No solid CTA fills that compete with the logo
- Non-regional, global design language
- Calm, premium, privacy-first aesthetic

Any future UI changes must:
- Preserve translucency
- Preserve logo hierarchy
- Avoid solid dominant colors

---

## Status
**LOCKED** — Do not deviate without explicit approval.

## Purpose
This document prevents visual and brand drift for Privxx.

---

## Approved Direction
- Vibrant, modern, AI-futurist look
- Layered background with depth
- Glassmorphism central card
- Teal / aqua / cyan accents
- Deep blue base (not black, not grey)

Privxx must feel:
- Global
- Human-first
- Modern / AI-futurist
- Trustworthy
- Vibrant but controlled

---

## Background Rules

Background must visually represent two conceptual layers:

**Layer A — Browsing / Internet**
- Globe, network nodes, connection paths
- Soft abstract "web" geometry

**Layer B — Payments / Finance**
- Card shapes, currency symbols, transaction flows
- Subtle financial nodes

These elements must be abstract and tasteful, not literal illustrations.

**Banned:**
- No people
- No cultural or regional imagery
- No stock photos

---

## Color Palette

Primary tones:
- Teal / Aqua / Cyan gradients
- Deep blue background base
- Subtle warm accent gradients (pink / gold / green blend near bottom)

Rules:
- No grey-dominant UI
- No pure white backgrounds
- No black backgrounds
- Maintain high contrast but soft edges

---

## UI Card (Center Panel)

- Glassmorphism style with soft blur
- Rounded corners, floating effect

Required elements (in order):
1. URL input with globe icon
2. Primary CTA button
3. Status indicator (Idle / Connecting / Secure)

CTA button:
- Glass / translucent style matching card
- No solid teal fill
- Includes Privxx logo styling
- Logo must be clearly visible, not competing with background
- Must feel confident and inviting

---

## Logo Usage

"Privxx" must always appear in official logo styling:
- Same font, capitalization, spacing
- Same accent on the "xx"

Applies everywhere: header, buttons, status text, CTAs, screenshots.

❌ Never render as plain text  
❌ Never restyle per component

---

## xx Mark (FINAL)

The xx mark is now the official teal xx Network logo asset.
Rendered as "Priv" text + xx logo image (transparent PNG).

Rules:
- Do NOT redesign the xx
- Do NOT reinterpret the xx
- Do NOT change its geometry
- Do NOT animate or stylize it independently
- Logo bottom aligns with text baseline
- Tight spacing — must look like part of the word

---

## Language Selector

- Single globe icon
- Dropdown list
- Alphabetical order
- English always pinned at the top

No flag icons.

---

## Brand Principle

Privxx is not:
- Regional
- Minimal for the sake of minimalism
- Cold or sterile
- Dark or oppressive

**Privxx stands for:**

> Private access to the internet and payments — without fear, friction, or exposure.

The UI should feel like:
- Safety
- Confidence
- Clarity
- Momentum

---

## What to Avoid

- Flat white or grey designs
- Dark or oppressive themes
- Pastel wellness aesthetics
- Literal illustrations (people, money piles)
- Cultural styling
- Reverting to previous rejected versions
- Experimenting visually without approval

---

## What NOT to Do

❌ "Simplify" further  
❌ Introduce cultural styling  
❌ Revert to previous rejected versions  
❌ Experiment visually without approval

**This direction is approved and locked.**
