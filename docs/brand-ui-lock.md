## Brand Meaning

Privxx represents private, secure access to both:
- the internet (browsing)

It must feel:
- global
- human-first
- modern
- safe
- confident
- vibrant (never dark or sterile)

## Design Lock

The approved visual style is:
- layered background
- vibrant gradient spheres
- glassmorphism central card
- strong teal / aqua / cyan accents
- deep blue base (not black, not grey)

**All previous minimal, flat, grey, or dark designs are deprecated.**

## Background Rules

Background must always represent two layers:
1. Browsing / network layer (globe, connections, web abstractions)
2. Payments layer (cards, currency, transactions – abstract only)

- No people.
- No cultural motifs.
- No stock-photo look.
