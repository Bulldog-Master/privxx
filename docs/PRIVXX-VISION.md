# Privxx Vision

Privxx is a **privacy-first browsing and payments tunnel**.

Its purpose is to protect:
- Network metadata (IP, location, timing patterns)
- Device identifiers
- Behavioral patterns

using:
- cMixx (metadata-shredding mixnet)
- Post-quantum-safe cryptography

In Phase 1, the UI simulates a private connection.  
Real cMixx integration comes later.

## Why Privxx?

Traditional privacy tools (VPNs, Tor) leave gaps:
- VPNs require trusting the provider
- Tor is vulnerable to timing attacks
- Neither protects against quantum threats

Privxx solves this with:
- **No trust required** – privacy from math, not promises
- **Timing protection** – mixnet destroys correlation
- **Future-proof crypto** – resistant to quantum attacks

## Design Principles

1. **Privacy by default** – No toggles or settings needed
2. **Zero knowledge** – We can't see what you browse
3. **Zero retention** – Nothing stored, nothing to leak
4. **Post-quantum ready** – Protected against future threats

## Target Use Cases

- Private banking and financial transactions
- Sensitive healthcare access
- Journalist/activist communications
- General browsing without surveillance
- Payments without merchant tracking
