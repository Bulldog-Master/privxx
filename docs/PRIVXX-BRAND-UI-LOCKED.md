# 🔒 PRIVXX — LOCKED DESIGN & BRAND INSTRUCTIONS (DO NOT DEVIATE)

## 1. DESIGN DIRECTION — LOCKED

Use the latest approved visual style provided by the user (the vibrant, layered, modern UI with floating gradient spheres and glass card).

**This look is final and locked.**

Do not revert to:
- flat white
- grey minimal
- dark/black themes
- abstract waves
- regional or cultural motifs

Privxx must feel:
- Global
- Human-first
- Modern / AI-futurist
- Trustworthy
- Vibrant but controlled

---

## 2. BACKGROUND — REQUIRED (TWO LAYERS)

The background must always have two conceptual layers:

**Layer A — Browsing / Internet**
Visual cues such as:
- globe
- network nodes
- connection paths
- soft abstract "web" geometry

**Layer B — Payments / Finance**
Subtle but clear cues such as:
- card shapes
- dollar / currency symbols
- transaction flows
- financial nodes

⚠️ These elements must be abstract and tasteful, not literal illustrations.

- No people.
- No culture-specific imagery.
- No stock-photo vibes.

---

## 3. COLOR PALETTE — LOCKED

Primary tones:
- Teal / Aqua / Cyan gradients
- Deep blue background base
- Subtle warm accent gradients (pink / gold / green blend near bottom)

Rules:
- No grey-dominant UI
- No pure white backgrounds
- No black backgrounds
- Maintain high contrast but soft edges

---

## 4. LOGO & WORDMARK — STRICT RULE

"Privxx" must always appear identical to the main logo:
- Same font
- Same capitalization
- Same spacing
- Same accent on the "xx"

This applies everywhere:
- Header
- Buttons
- Status text
- CTAs
- Docs screenshots

❌ Never type "Privxx" as plain text
❌ Never restyle it per component

If it says "Privxx", it must look like the logo.

---

## 5. xx SYMBOL — PROVISIONAL (IMPORTANT)

The current xx mark is a placeholder.

Rules until final xx asset is provided:
- Do NOT redesign the xx
- Do NOT reinterpret the xx
- Do NOT change its geometry
- Do NOT animate or stylize it independently

Treat the xx as a reserved brand element that will be swapped later.

---

## 6. UI CARD (CENTER PANEL)

- Glassmorphism style
- Soft blur
- Rounded corners
- Floating effect

Required elements (in this order):
1. URL input with globe icon
2. Primary CTA button
3. Status indicator (Idle / Connecting / Secure)

CTA button:
- Uses brand gradient
- Includes Privxx logo styling
- Must feel confident and inviting

---

## 7. LANGUAGE SELECTOR

- Single globe icon
- Dropdown list
- Alphabetical order
- English always pinned at the top

No flag icons.

---

## 8. BRAND PRINCIPLE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Privxx is not:
- regional
- minimal for the sake of minimalism
- cold or sterile
- dark or oppressive

**Privxx stands for:**

> Private access to the internet and payments — without fear, friction, or exposure.

The UI should feel like:
- safety
- confidence
- clarity
- momentum

---

## 9. WHAT NOT TO DO (FINAL WARNING)

Do NOT:
- "simplify" further
- introduce cultural styling
- revert to previous rejected versions
- experiment visually without approval

**This direction is approved and locked.**
