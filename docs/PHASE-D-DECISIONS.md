# Phase D Decisions (Locked)

## Objective
Prove cMixx integration with minimal scope and zero UI changes.

## Decisions
1. UI is locked. No design changes during Phase D.
2. Phase D uses cMixx as a private control channel first.
3. Secure state must be triggered by a real cMixx event.
4. Full HTTP-like proxy routing is out of scope for Phase D.
5. Evidence required: screenshots + client/server logs.

## Why
This reduces risk, prevents scope creep, and creates a credible proof milestone.
