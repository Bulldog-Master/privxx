# Privxx — One-Pager (Non-Technical)

## What Privxx Is
Privxx is a privacy-first access layer for browsing and payments.  
It is designed to protect **metadata** (like IP address, location, and timing correlation) while keeping the user experience simple and familiar.

## Why Metadata Matters
Even when content is encrypted, metadata can still reveal:
- who you are
- where you are
- what you're accessing
- when you're doing it

Privxx is built to reduce those signals.

## How Privxx Works (Conceptually)
Privxx is built in two layers:

### 1) Experience Layer (What users see)
- Calm, modern interface
- Simple states: Idle → Connecting → Secure
- Clear privacy explanations in human language
- Consistent brand identity

This layer is **locked**.

### 2) Privacy Layer (What happens underneath)
- Powered by xx Network **cMixx**
- Designed to prevent metadata correlation
- Intended to be post-quantum resilient by design

This layer is being integrated next.

## Current Status
- UI and brand are locked
- Demo flow exists and is consistent
- Routing is currently simulated for prototype purposes
- No misleading "live privacy" claims are made

## Next Milestone (Phase D)
Phase D proves real **cMixx integration** by:
- sending connection intent over cMixx (control channel)
- transitioning to Secure based on real events
- keeping the UI unchanged

## What Privxx Is Not
- Not a "dark web" tool
- Not a wallet replacement
- Not a VPN clone
- Not complicated or technical to use

## The Goal
Make advanced privacy feel normal.
