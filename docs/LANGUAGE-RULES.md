# Privxx Language Rules (i18n)

## Purpose
Ensure translations stay consistent, trustworthy, and legally safe across all languages.

## Brand Terms (Never Translate)
- Privxx
- cMixx
- xxDK
- xx Network

Keep capitalization exactly as shown.

## Tone
- Calm, modern, human-first
- Avoid fear, hype, or absolutist privacy claims

## Avoid These Words
Do not use equivalents of:
- "anonymous / untraceable / perfect privacy"
- "military-grade"
- "100% secure"

Preferred concepts:
- "private"
- "metadata reduction"
- "private routing"
- "preview/demo"

## Demo Disclosure
Any demo disclaimer must clearly indicate simulation:
- Use "Demo mode / Preview mode"
- State that routing is simulated until integration

## UI Brevity
- Status main text should be 1–2 words (e.g., Idle / Connecting / Secure)
- Subtext should be short (ideally ≤ 32 characters where possible)

## Punctuation & Style
- Keep sentence case (not ALL CAPS)
- Avoid excessive exclamation marks
- Prefer simple, widely understood phrasing

## RTL Languages (Arabic, Urdu)
- Ensure proper RTL rendering
- Keep product names in Latin characters (Privxx, cMixx) as-is

## Consistency Rule
If an English string changes:
- Update all translations in the same PR/commit
- Do not leave languages partially updated
