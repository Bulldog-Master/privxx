# Privxx Threat Model Notes (Internal)

## What Privxx is designed to do
- Reduce metadata exposure (e.g., IP address, location, timing patterns)
- Make privacy-preserving routing usable without technical setup
- Avoid tracking and telemetry by default

## What Privxx does NOT claim
- Perfect or absolute anonymity
- Immunity to device compromise
- Protection against malicious browser extensions
- Protection against all adversaries in all scenarios

## Out of scope (for now)
- Native app platform hardening
- Hardware-backed key storage
- Advanced anti-fingerprinting claims

## Messaging consistency rule
Always use "helps reduce" and "designed to", and clearly state "does not promise absolute anonymity".
