# Privxx Backend Placeholder

This file exists to ensure the backend/ directory is tracked in Git.

---

## Status: Phase 1 (Simulated)

The Privxx backend does not exist yet. The frontend UI uses simulated 
behavior to demonstrate the user experience.

---

## What Will Go Here (Phase 2+)

- Privxx Proxy Server (Go or Rust)
- xxDK integration code
- cMixx message handlers
- Configuration files
- Docker/deployment configs

---

## When to Build

Build the backend AFTER:
1. cMixx integration is tested separately
2. xxDK bindings are verified
3. Proxy prototype works in isolation
4. Frontend UI is finalized

---

## Privacy Reminder

All backend code must follow Privxx Privacy Laws:
- No logging
- No analytics  
- No persistent identifiers
- No trust in intermediaries
- Zero retention

See: docs/PRIVXX-PRIVACY-LAWS.md
