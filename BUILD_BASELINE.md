# Privxx Build Baseline — Phase 6

Phase 6 finalizes **real xxDK + cMixx integration** behind the authenticated bridge.

## What Works
- JWT auth via Supabase
- Identity unlock / TTL enforcement
- Real xxDK backend running
- Bridge health reflects backend xxDK readiness
- Secure connect flow validated

## What Is Explicitly Locked
- No frontend xxDK access
- No browser keys
- No direct backend exposure

Next phase starts messaging.
